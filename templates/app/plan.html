There are also no compromises with unlimited talk and text plans with varied data options and some of the latest technology including 4G LTE and Sprint Spark capable devices. You simply 1) choose a compatible Sprint Prepaid phone, 2) select a plan based on your phone and how much data you want to use per month and 3) activate and prepay each month for your service.

        The easiest way to manage your account is to visit sprint.com/prepaidmysprint any time to activate your device, Reload your account, manage your plan, set up AutoPay options and more. You can also Reload your account any time by going to a Sprint store near you or dialing *3 from your Sprint Prepaid phone. Your first monthly plan payment must be paid in advance of using the phone on the Nationwide Sprint Network. If your new cash balance is equal to or greater than your next monthly payment amount after you Reload, we will automatically make an Advance Payment towards your next month's service. Reload an amount greater than your monthly payment for additional services such as directory assistance, or calls to select international locations while on the Nationwide Sprint Network.

        In most instances, yes. , "Porting-in" means bringing your phone number to a new phone company. Porting-out means taking your phone number from your existing phone company. Wireless Local Number Portability (WLNP) allows you to take your phone number with you when switching phone companies but may not be available from all telecommunications companies. NOTE: Porting your wireless number from certain carriers may not be available or limited, depending on your carrier. See your Sprint Prepaid store associate for details.Once you have your new Sprint Prepaid phone, go to sprint.com/prepaidactivate, click Activate, and select "I want to switch my number from another company to Sprint Prepaid." We'll be able to guide you from there. Please note that if you currently have a different Sprint device (other than Sprint Prepaid), you'll still need to go through this process to keep your phone number. To expedite the transfer, we request that you have a current bill from your existing carrier to provide us with your customer information; inaccurate information will delay the process:Phone numberAccount number from your old providerSocial Security Number (SSN) or Tax IDBilling name and addressAccount password from your old provider (if applicable)
